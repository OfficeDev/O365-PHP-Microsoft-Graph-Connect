# Office 365 PHP Connect sample using unified API (preview)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OfficeDev/O365-PHP-Unified-API-Connect.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/OfficeDev/O365-PHP-Unified-API-Connect)

Connecting to Office 365 is the first step every app must take to start working with Office 365 services and data. This sample shows how to connect and then call one API through the unified API (preview), and uses the Office Fabric UI to create an Office 365 experience.

## Prerequisites

To use the Office 365 PHP Connect sample, you need the following:

* [PHP](http://php.net/) is required to run the sample on a development server. The sample has been tested on PHP 5.6 on Internet Information Services and Apache Server.
	* Client URL (cURL) module. The web application uses cURL to issue requests to REST endpoints. 
* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=6881A1CB-F4EB-4db3-9F18-388898DAF510&DL=DEVELOPERPACK&ali=1#0) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.

     > Note: If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends you to a page with the message *Sorry, you canâ€™t add that to your current account*. In that case use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.
     > Note: If you are already signed-in to Office 365, the Sign-in button in the previous link shows the message *Sorry, we can't process your request*. In that case sign-out from Office 365 in that same page and sign-in again.
* A Microsoft Azure tenant to register your application. Azure Active Directory (AD) provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

     > Important: You also need to make sure your Azure subscription is bound to your Office 365 tenant. To do this, see the Active Directory team's blog post, [Creating and Managing Multiple Windows Azure Active Directories](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/11/08/creating-and-managing-multiple-windows-azure-active-directories.aspx). The section **Adding a new directory** will explain how to do this. You can also see [Set up your Office 365 development environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_CreateAzureSubscription) and the section **Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps** for more information.
* A [```client ID```](app/Constants.php#L29), [```key```](app/Constants.php#L30), and [```reply URL```](app/Constants.php#L31) values of an application registered in Azure. This sample application must be granted the **Send mail as signed-in user** permission for the **Office 365 unified API (preview)**. For details see [Register your brower-based web app with the Azure Management Portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/HowTo/add-common-consent-manually#bk_RegisterWebApp) and [grant proper permissions to the Connect application](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-Android-Unified-API-Connect/wiki/Grant-permissions-to-the-Connect-application-in-Azure).

     > Note: During the app registration process, make sure to specify **http://localhost/your\_web\_application/Callback.php** as the **Sign-on URL**.

## Configure and run the app

1. Map a web application in your web server to the **app** folder in your local repository. 
2. Using your favorite IDE, open **Constants.php** in the *app* folder.
3. Replace *{YOUR AZURE CLIENT ID HERE}* with the client ID of your registered Azure application.
4. Replace *{YOUR AZURE KEY HERE}* with the client secret of your registered Azure application.
5. Replace *{YOUR AZURE REPLY URL HERE}* with the reply URL of your registered Azure application. 
6. Navigate to ```http://localhost/<your_web_application>/Connect.php``` in your web browser.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Unable to get local issuer certificate

You receive the following error after providing your credentials to the sign in page.
```
SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

cURL can't verify the validity of the Microsoft certificate when trying to issue a request call to get tokens. You must configure cURL to use a certificate when issuing https requests by following these steps:  

1. Download the cacert.pem file from [cURL website](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html). 
2. Open your php.ini file and add the following line

	```
	curl.cainfo = "path_to_cacert/cacert.pem"
	```
